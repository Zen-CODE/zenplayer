# ZenPlayer


ZenPlayer is a minimal audio player written in Python using the [Kivy framework](http://www.kivy.org).
It is toy application, built by the author for personal use and not intended for public
consumption. None the less, just like Kivy itself, it is free and released under the
Open Source MIT License.

Massive thanks to the Kivy community, and credit to the following people:
