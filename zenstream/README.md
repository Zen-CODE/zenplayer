# ZenStream


```"Be like water making its way through cracks."``` - *Bruce Lee*


## Introduction

ZenStream is a browser-based file explorer, viewer, analyzer, visualizer and extractor. Think of it as a live, code-able dashboard over your file system.

We try to flow through our files, without the context switching of the monkey mind, looking at, analyzing and thinking about our data.
